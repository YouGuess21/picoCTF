# Solution

The question gave me a linux commmand. I ran the command and it opened a shop giving me options to buy food items.

Interestingly, one of the options was fruitful flag, which presumably would give me the flag.
But I didn't have enough to coins to buy it. I tried buying a fruit, and it reduced the number of coins I had.

Then I thought what if I tried to buy negative 6 quiche. Theoretically I was selling 6 quiche back to the shop. That worked and I had 100 coins.
I bought the flag and it was in ascii.

I put that into a ascii to character converter and got the flag.

Required flag: picoCTF{b4d_brogrammer_797b292c}
