# Solution 

From the description, it seems like file will contain huge amounts of data and we will just have to use grep command with flag prefix to get our flag.

Yep. Precisely.

```terminal
youguess@youguess-Inspiron-14-5410-2-in-1:~/Downloads/picoctf/forensics/lookeyhere$ grep pico anthem.flag.txt 
      we think that the men of picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}

```

#### Required flag : picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}
